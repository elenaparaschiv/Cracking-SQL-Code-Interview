# Cracking the SQL Code Interview 

## Description of repo 
In this project we are solving SQL Interview Questions from FAANG companies, such as Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Amazon etc.

The questions are sourced from https://www.stratascratch.com/ and have my own solution to the problems

There are 3 levels: Easy, Medium and Hard and we are improving on multiple  SQL Concepts.
The concepts are listed in this documentation and we are referencing the topics covered to the interview question ID for further practice. 

## Structure
The repo is divided according to the difficulty of the problem:

At each level {company_name}_{interview_question}_{id} is referenced
The source files are in the csv folder and the solution is in solution.sql

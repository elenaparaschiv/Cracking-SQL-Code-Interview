# Cracking the SQL Code Interview 

In this project we are solving SQL Interview Questions from FAANG companies, such as Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Amazon etc.

The questions are sourced from https://www.stratascratch.com/ and have my own solution to the problems

There are 3 levels: Easy, Medium and Hard and we are improving on multiple Topic families

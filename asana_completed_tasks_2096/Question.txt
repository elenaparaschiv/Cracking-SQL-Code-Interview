Find the number of tasks completed in January 2022 by users who work at ClassPass.
The completed tasks are these rows in the asana_actions table with 'action_name' equal
to CompleteTask. Note that each row in the dataset indicates how many actions of a certain 
type one user has performed in one day and the number of actions is stored in the 'num_actions' column.
Output the ID of the user and the number of tasks they completed.
If a user from this company did not complete any tasks in the given period of time, 
you should still output their ID and the number 0 in the second column.
